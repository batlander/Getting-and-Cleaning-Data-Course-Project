Getting and Cleaning Data   -   Week 4

The R script does the following:

	Load the activity and feature info
    Loads the training and test datasets, selects columns: mean or standard deviation
    Loads the activity and subject data and merges columns with the dataset
    Converts the activity and subject columns into labels
    Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean of each variable per subject and activity pair.
 
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
