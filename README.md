# Getting and Cleaning Data   -   Week 4

The R script does the following:

1. Load the activity and feature info
2. Loads the training and test datasets, selects columns: mean or standard deviation
3. Loads the activity and subject data and merges columns with the dataset
4. Converts the activity and subject columns into labels
5. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean of each variable per subject and activity pair.
 
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
